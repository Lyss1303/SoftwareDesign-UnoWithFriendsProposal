## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Proof of Concept
you can run UnoWithFriends class to test the socket connection and run JFrameTry to view demonstration of how those libraries will be used in the project. both of these can be run using an ide that runs java code and junit tests. the compiler used is javac 11.0.22 and the operating system is chrome Version 121.0.6167.159.
